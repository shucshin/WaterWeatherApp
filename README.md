# Water Weather App
Project developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 with teamname [Catadores de Pinwinos](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/find-a-team/catadores-de-pinwinos/?tab=project#project_demo) for the [What's Up With This Water?](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/whats-up-with-this-water/) challenge.
An interactive map is available with pop-ups to view water weather conditions as well as endangered species nearby.
Integrated QR codes within the pop-up pins to enable visualization of endangered species with augmented reality.
